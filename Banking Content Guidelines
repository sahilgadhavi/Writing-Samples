## 🗣️ Tone of Voice Principles

| Principle     | Description                                     | Example                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Clear         | Use plain, unambiguous language                 | 'Enter your 6-digit PIN'         |
| Human         | Speak like a helpful advisor, not a machine     | 'Let’s get you set up'           |
| Assured       | Instill trust through confident phrasing        | 'Your transfer is on its way'    |
| Inclusive     | Respect all users, across languages & contexts  | 'Primary account holder” instead of “Head of household' |

## 🌍 Localization Notes

- Use neutral, culturally portable language. Avoid idioms like 'You’re good to go.'
- Avoid over-reliance on color or icons — support text must convey intent clearly.
- Date and currency formatting must follow local standards (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY in India).
